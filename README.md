# Helping Hands: elevate-hackathon-2018
Helping Hands is an automation system designed towards improving the lives of seniors with daily accessibility issues. The system allows users to control various electrical appliances both inside and outside their homes (room lighting, door opening, ramp deployment etc.) through voice control and facial recognition.  

# Inspiration
In Canada, the senior population is rising. Cost effective and modular automation systems can allow for improved lives for seniors suffering from mobility issues.

# What it does
The system integrates several platforms together to create a cost effective solution to various day-to-day activities.

# How we built it
Alexa -> AWS Lamba -> AWS IoT -> Arduino
Amazon Rekognition -> AWS Lambda -> AWS IoT -> Arduino

# Challenges we ran into
To avoid issues during project demo, the software had to use a video stream input instead of real-time captured images.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Integration of the 5 major parts (Alexa, Amazon Rekognition, AWS Lamba, AWS IoT, Arduino)

# What we learned
Breaking down projects with large scopes to smaller deliverables, and integration of these deliverables is critical for agile development.

# What's next for Helping Hands
* Modularize the addition of more IoT for each user
* Develop an intuitive GUI to display current device states
